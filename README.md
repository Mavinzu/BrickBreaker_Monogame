# Brick Breaker - Monogame

***This game is made using the Monogame framework, the purpose of this game is just to train problem solving skills and bug analysis related to programming, the ability to program something can only be improved by direct practice.*** <br> <br>
  ***However, practicing creating a program without an example would be very difficult, so I decided to take the *BRICK BREAKER* game as an example in creating this second project.***
